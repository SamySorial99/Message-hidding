# Message-hidding
Hidding a message in a PNG picture using python
This is a project to hide a message in a picture
this is done by converting the message into a ASCII code 
then inserting the code into specific pixels in the picture
we then save the new encoded picture

How to use:
Choose 1 to encode a picture, you will be asked to enter a picture name
you should enter picture dot it's formate like "Sample.png"
The picture you enter should be in a png formate to prevent any lossy conversions in the bits of the photo
then you will be asked for the result picture name
then the text you want to hide
WARNING : TEXT SHOULD NOT EXCEED 255 CHARACTERS, AND PICTURE CHOSEN SHOULD HAVE HIGH RESOLUTION 
Image choosen should be in the folder of the project as to be opened
